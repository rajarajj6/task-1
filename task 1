1.What is difference between http1 1 and http2?
  HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection,
  while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the
  sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.
  The primary advantage of HTTP/2 is its improved speed over HTTP/1.1. 
  This is achieved thanks to a combination of elements: HTTP/2 is binary,
  instead of textual meaning it is more compact, travels faster 'on the wire' and is less susceptible to errors. HTTP/2 is fully multiplexed.


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?
  Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
  These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)
  in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
  Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
  An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
  That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
  Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
  These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
  For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
